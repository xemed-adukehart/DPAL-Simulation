Version 0.1:
Currently, the program is able to simulate the dynamics of the space debris and the cross-section of the DPAL beam.
Detection happens using a simple collision detection routine and is done via brute force.
During testing, the average time per run is approximately 50 s and requires >1MB of memory.
